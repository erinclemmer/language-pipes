# Security

## Concerns (Important!)
While data transmition is encrypted via HTTPS so that users outside of the network cannot view the data being transmitted; we cannot be sure that the servers on the network are not recording the prompts and responses that are being processed through that machine. This means that either users must understand that their prompts could be spied on or that everyone that makes up the computational network can be trusted not to snoop.
